# MassSlateDraw
This projects demonstrates an unusual way of leveraging Mass' processors to batch and process screenspace projections and then batch and process drawing of elements in slate.

This project was built on Unreal Engine version UE5.1.1.
Mass is still evolving a lot and I cannot guarantee this project compiles on versions before or after the listed one.
